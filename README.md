# Astronaut Sucht Freunde

Being alone on his planet for so long, a little astronaut begins his search for new friends in the galaxy. But they don't want to be his friends, so he has to force them. With force... Four different planets, each with a unique boss fight will challenge the player on the quest for finding friends while trying to keep their ship steady in orbit. When the bosses are defeated the player has to bring them back to their home planet in order to gain new abilites.
